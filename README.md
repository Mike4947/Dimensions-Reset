**DimensionsReset** is a powerful and feature-rich server utility designed to handle the most requested server maintenance task: dimension resetting. Go beyond simple manual resets with a fully automated, configurable, and safe system to keep your server's worlds fresh and engaging for your players.

This plugin is built for **Minecraft 1.21+** and modern Paper servers.

## ✨ Core Features

  * **🛡️ Safe Dimension Resets:** Reliably resets The End by unloading, deleting, and regenerating the dimension files in a carefully timed, multi-stage process to prevent errors.
  * **🗓️ Full Automation:** The ultimate "set it and forget it" feature. Configure recurring resets based on an interval (e.g., every 7 days) or a specific day and time (e.g., every Friday at 8:00 PM).
  * **⏰ Flexible Manual Scheduling:** Need a one-off reset? Easily schedule it to run at a future time (`1h30m`) or trigger it instantly with the `now` command.
  * **🔭 Spectator Preview Mode:** Use `/dr preview before` to safely inspect the current state of The End in spectator mode without affecting your character's location or inventory.
  * **🌱 Seed Information:** Use `/dr preview seed` to check the seed that will be used for the next reset, allowing you to preview the generated world in single-player or online tools.
  * **✅ Confirmation System:** A mandatory `/dr confirm` step for all instant manual resets helps prevent catastrophic accidents.
  * **📢 Engaging Announcements:** Keep your entire server informed with configurable countdown messages in chat, dramatic on-screen titles, and immersive sound effects.
  * **⌨️ Smart Tab Completion:** A professional command interface that suggests subcommands, arguments, and permissions, making the plugin incredibly easy to use.
  * **🔄 Configuration Reload:** Reload the `config.yml` on the fly with `/dr reload`.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  Download the latest stable release from the [Releases](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Mike4947/DimensionsReset/releases) page.
2.  Place the `DimensionsReset-vX.X.X.jar` file into your server's `/plugins` directory.
3.  Start your server. The plugin will generate a `plugins/DimensionsReset/` folder containing the `config.yml` and `data.yml` files.

## 📋 Commands & Permissions

The main command is `/dr` (aliases: `/dims`, `/dreset`).

| Command | Description | Permission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/dr reset the_end <time\|now>` | Schedules or initiates a reset for The End. | `dimensionsreset.admin` |
| `/dr cancel` | Cancels any currently scheduled manual reset. | `dimensionsreset.admin` |
| `/dr confirm` | Confirms an immediate manual reset. | `dimensionsreset.admin` |
| `/dr status` | Checks the time remaining until the next manual reset. | `dimensionsreset.admin` |

| `/dr reload` | Reloads the `config.yml` file from disk. | `dimensionsreset.reload` |

## ⚙️ Configuration (`config.yml`)

The plugin is highly configurable. Here are the most important sections:

### Automated Resets

This is the most powerful feature. You can define multiple recurring schedules in the `schedules` list.

```yaml
automated_resets:
  enabled: true
  schedules:
    - id: "weekly_end_reset" # A unique name for this schedule.
      dimension: "the_end"
      announcement_time: "1h" # How long before the reset to start the countdown.
      schedule:
        type: "INTERVAL" # Can be INTERVAL or DAY_AND_TIME
        value: "7d"      # For INTERVAL: d=days, h=hours, m=minutes

    - id: "friday_night_end"
      dimension: "the_end"
      announcement_time: "30m"
      schedule:
        type: "DAY_AND_TIME"
        value: "FRIDAY-20:00" # Resets every Friday at 8:00 PM server time.
```

### Other Sections

  * **`confirmation`**: Customize messages for the `/dr confirm` safety system.
  * **`messages`**: Change any server broadcast or command response. Use the `%time%` and `%seed%` placeholders where applicable.
  * **`countdown_broadcast_times`**: A list of times (in seconds) to broadcast a countdown message.
  * **`sounds`**: Change the sound effects for key events. Find sound keys on the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sounds.json).
  * **`preview`**: Customize messages for the preview feature.

## 💾 Data File (`data.yml`)

This plugin generates a `data.yml` file inside its folder.

  * **Purpose:** This file stores the timestamps of when each automated reset last occurred. This is how the plugin remembers when to run the next reset, even after a server restart.
  * **Warning:** Please do not edit this file manually unless you know what you are doing.
