**DimensionsReset** is a professional-grade server utility designed to handle the complex task of resetting dimensions. It provides a powerful, stable, and user-friendly solution for managing your server's worlds, from fully automated recurring resets to safe, manual commands.

This plugin is built for **Minecraft 1.21+** and modern Paper servers.

## ✨ Core Features

* **🌀 Multi-Dimension Resets:** Reliably reset both `the_end` and `the_nether` with simple commands.
* **🗓️ Full Automation:** A powerful "set it and forget it" scheduler allows you to configure recurring resets based on an interval or a specific day and time.
* **🖥️ GUI Control Panel:** An intuitive and easy-to-use `/dr gui` command opens a menu to manage all major plugin functions with simple clicks.
* **🛡️ Stable Reset Process:** Dimension resets are handled safely to ensure portals and game mechanics work perfectly after completion without requiring a server restart.
* **🔭 Spectator Preview Mode:** Use `/dr preview before <dimension>` to safely inspect the current state of a world in spectator mode.
* **⌨️ Smart Tab Completion:** A professional command interface that suggests commands and arguments as you type.
* **📢 Engaging Announcements:** Keep your players informed with configurable countdowns, server-wide messages, and sound effects.
* **✅ Confirmation System:** A mandatory `/dr confirm` step for instant manual resets prevents accidents.
